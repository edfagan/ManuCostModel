The Manufacturing Cost Model (ManuCostModel) is a python package developed for
modelling the manufacturing costs of products made from fibre reinforced composite
materials.

The cost model was developed with a generic wing design in mind, consisting of a
structural I-beam spar supporting an aerodynamic skin. The design is also applicable
to standard wind turbine blade construction.
